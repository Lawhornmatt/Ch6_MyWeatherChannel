GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

## HOW TO:

Follow the link below to open SCHEDUTRON-3000

Time blocks that are in the past display as a <span style="color:rgb(194, 92, 25)">burnt-orange rust color.</span> These blocks of time will be uneditable- they're in past! Get to the present!

Present and future blocks of time are editable. They will be a black field with <span style="color:greenyellow; background:black">bright green text on top.</span> The current present hour will have it's time field as an alert triangle, pulsing between black and green!

Record whatever events you have at that event hour and hit that save floppy in the right hand column. Now your event will be present whenever you return to the webpage.
